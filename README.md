#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to software development. It involves designing, developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining software applications to meet user needs.

Importance in the Technology Industry:
Ensures Reliability and Efficiency: Well-engineered software is stable, secure, and efficient.
Enhances Scalability: Proper software engineering allows systems to grow and adapt to increasing user demands.
Reduces Costs and Time: Using structured development processes minimizes errors, reducing rework and saving resources.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1950s-1960s: The Birth of Software Engineering980s-1990s: Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Methodologies
Languages like C++ and Java introduced OOP principles, improving modularity and reusability.
2000s-Present: DevOps, Cloud Computing, and AI Integration
DevOps bridges development and operations for continuous integration and deployment.
Cloud computing revolutionized software delivery models (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS).
AI and automation influence modern software engineering through machine learning and predictive analytics.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning: Define project scope, feasibility, and objectives.
Requirements Analysis: Gather and document user needs.
Design: Create system architecture and design specifications.
Implementation (Coding): Develop the actual software.
Testing: Verify functionality, performance, and security.
Deployment: Release the software to users.
Maintenance: Provide updates, bug fixes, and improvements.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

waterfall methodology - Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. 
- there is Low flexibility,
 changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
 - Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
 - Testing is done at the end of the development process.
agile methodology - Interative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints). 
- High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. 
- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 
- Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer - developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
 - maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. 
- collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.
 - reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.
Quality Assurance Engineer - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
 - create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow
 - confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment. 
- analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient. 
- develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.
Project Manager - assembles and lead the software development team.
 - discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers.
 - create blueprint for the project.
 - tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
 - deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. eg Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
importance:
Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured. Because an IDE knows these rules, it contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code.
An IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors. These visual cues make the source code more readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors.
an IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.
IDEs increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change. The following are some examples of regular coding tasks that an IDE carries out.
An IDE compiles or converts the code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand. - Some programming languages implement just-in-time compiling, in which the IDE converts human-readable code into machine code from within the application.
The IDE allows developers to automate unit tests locally before the software is integrated with other developers' code and more complex integration tests are run.
Debugging IDE enables a step through the code, line by line, as it runs and inspect code behavior. IDEs also integrate several debugging tools that highlight bugs caused by human error in real time, even as the developer is typing.

Version Control Systems (VCS) - are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. eg Git
importance:
Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.
Change Tracking: Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification. 
-Branching and Merging: Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
Error Recovery: Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

-rapid technological advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current.
 Solution: adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry. -
Time Constraints - Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines.
 Solution: adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints 
-Limited Infrastructure - limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures. 
 Solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.
Changing Software Requirements - Software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes, making it challenging for engineers to design and develop solutions that meet users' needs while accounting for future updates and bug fixes. 
Solution: engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design, which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.
Software Security - Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task. 
Solution: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats
Software Accessibility and Usability - Overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users. 
Solution: Use scalable architecture, Emphasize reliability.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing: Tests individual components to ensure correctness.
Integration Testing: Verifies interactions between integrated modules.
System Testing: Evaluates the complete system’s behavior.
Acceptance Testing: Confirms the system meets user and business requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting well-structured input prompts to optimize the responses generated by AI models. It involves understanding how AI interprets queries and refining prompts to improve accuracy, clarity, and relevance.

Importance of Prompt Engineering in AI Interactions:
Enhances Accuracy: Well-structured prompts reduce ambiguity and lead to more precise responses.
Improves Efficiency: Saves time by reducing back-and-forth clarifications.
Optimizes AI Capabilities: Helps leverage AI for complex tasks like summarization, data analysis, or code generation.
Ensures Context Relevance: Keeps responses aligned with user intent.



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

❌ Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about cars."

✅ Improved Prompt:
"Provide an overview of electric cars, including their benefits, challenges, and popular models in 2024."

Why the Improved Prompt Is More Effective:
More Specific: Instead of "cars" (a broad topic), it focuses on electric cars.
Clearly Defined Scope: It requests an overview covering benefits, challenges, and models.
Timeframe Provided: The mention of 2024 ensures up-to-date information.
